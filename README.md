App using ASP.NET MVC

Hi Guys

Due to time pressue and work i chose very lite design with MVC showing all the fundamentals of SDLC. The solution is a plug and play just download source code and run in any latest visual studio IDE. I used VS 2022 IDE for this. I can also develop in Angular, React , APIs . Migration is setup as soon as you run compile and run the solution it will create database instance on MSSQL localhost. You must have MS SQL instance running localy. I have generated gmail SMTP password to be able to send emails but i will change it after 3 days i am sure by then review and testing would have been completed. I didnt get enough time to format my emails could have done a better html template. App can be published in IIS or Azure if you have the account.
